General Projects from the EECS22 and EECS22L series. 
- Directories of HW3 and HW4 are for PhotoLab assignment. This one saved some images and performed various filters on them
- HW5 is a TicTacTo game through the console performed with a randomized "AI"
- ChessV2 is a console based chess game that was coded with 2 other students. It employed the use of some socket programming to get "multiplayer" between different computers and also supported all chess moves.
