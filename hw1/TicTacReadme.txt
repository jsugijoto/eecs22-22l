I've completed the Tic Tac Whoa program. This program is working perfectly for the 3x3 version which is the default. The AI just takes the markerand places it in the first available part. For the settings, the colors and changing the symbols work, as well as the expanded board up to 10x10 and the custom win conditions. The only problem I have right now is changing the custom win condition before changing the boardSize because it overwrites it. Other than that issue, it should all be working fine. 

Best,
