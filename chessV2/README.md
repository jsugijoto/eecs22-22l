Description: We have written an online version of our previous chess game. There needs to be a server launched with the command: "./bin/server 11800" Then, two clients need to launch and connect to the port 11800 with the command: "./bin/client (server host is on) 11800. From there, the two need to login or signup and the two clients will pick their respective colors. Thus begins the game of chess.
